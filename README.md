# cigar-box-synth
This repo contains the software component of my arduino powered synthesizer. 

I used Platform.io to develope and test my code so it's a bit spread out over the repo. In the src folder the main.cpp file contains the code that the arduino executes. In the include folder (from the main repo not the src folder) there is the synth.h file where all my variables are defined and the functions.cpp file where all my functions defined.

I've never taken a class on C++, and this is my first big project using the language so hopefully my code is easily understandable. I did my best to comment everything I was doing. I hope this is helpful to you!
